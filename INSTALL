1 - 	Unpack. This should give a top-level directory with the subdirectories
    	listed in README, as well as a few documentation files and a Makefile.
    
2 - 	You need a SunOS (Sparc or i386), Linux i386/x86_64 or Mac OSX platform 
	to compile out of the box. Other platforms are untested.
    
3 - 	You need the following free third-party software to build XenC:

		- gcc version 4.2.1 or higher (older versions might work, 
		  but are untested)
		- GNU make
		- gzip, to read/write compressed files
		- boost version 1.52.0 or higher (may work with lower versions,
		  untested)
		- SRILM version 1.7.0 or higher (older versions won't work, since they are not thread-safe)

4 - 	By default, the Makefile will look into the /usr directory for boost
	(/usr/include/boost for includes, /usr/lib or /usr/lib64 for libraries), 
	but you can specify variables on the make command line:
	
		- BOOST, for another root directory for includes/libs
		- INCBOOST, for Boost includes directly
		- LIBBOOST, for Boost libs directly

	The (multithreaded) boost libraries used by XenC are : libboost_filesystem, 
	libboost_iostreams, libboost_program_options, libboost_regex, libboost_system and libboost_thread.

5 - 	By default, the Makefile will look into the /usr/local directory for SRILM
	(/usr/local/include for includes, /usr/local/lib for libraries), but you 
	can specify variables on the make command line:
	
		- SRILM, for another root directory for includes/libs
		- INCSRILM, for SRILM includes directly
		- LIBSRILM, for SRILM libs directly
	
	The SRILM libraries used by XenC are : libdstruct, libmisc
	and liboolm.
	
6 - 	In the top-level directory, run:

		make		or		make debug (with debug symbols)

	optionally with one or more variables described in steps 4 and 5.


7 - 	(Optional) To clean the obj directory of object files:

		make clean
