1 - 	Unpack. This should give a top-level directory with the subdirectories
    	listed in README, as well as a few documentation files and a Makefile.
    
2 - 	You need a SunOS (Sparc or i386), Linux i386/x86_64 or Mac OSX platform 
	to compile out of the box. Other platforms are untested.
    
3 - 	You need the following free third-party software to build XenC:

		- gcc version 4.5.1 or higher (older versions might work, 
		  but are untested)
		- CMake 2.8.4 or higher
		- boost version 1.57.0 or higher
		- gzip, to read/write compressed files

4 - 	In the top-level directory, run:

                cmake . (you can add -DBOOST=/path/to/your/boost if not in 
                        usual places)
		make
